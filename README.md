# Bank-Credit-Defaulter-Prediction

# Description:
In present day majority of people are using credit card for online 
shopping, EMI payments. Moreover, banks are encouraging 
customers to use it by approving them freely without any initial 
charges. Because credit card interest income is the major share of 
profit for all commercial banks. Even if customers are not willing to 
buy, bank marketing team reaches out through phone call to sell it. 
At first the interest rate is normal to grope the customer into the 
practice of using it, later they will levy charges on everything to loot 
money from the customers. Due to this reason many customers are 
facing difficulty in repaying the credit amount on time. If they missed 
the deadline the interest rate will get multiplied leading to 
defaulting the account if left unpaid even for a short span of time. 
The model we are going to build will consider all inputs from user to 
predict whether the account will be defaulted or not based on 
various parameters
